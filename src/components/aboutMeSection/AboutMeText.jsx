      <p>
      I’m Vijayapremanath, an undergraduate student at Trincomalee Campus, Eastern University, Sri Lanka, with a strong passion for game development. I specialize in creating games using Unreal Engine, Unity, and Pygame, focusing on both 2D and 3D experiences. I enjoy exploring new technologies in game design and development, constantly learning and improving my skills. My goal is to create engaging, interactive experiences while inspiring others through collaboration and innovation in the gaming world.
